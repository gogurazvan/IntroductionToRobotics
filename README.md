This project consists in controling an RGB LED using 3 potentiometers. You can change the intensity of each color by rotating the right potentiometer.<br>
The pontentiometers inputs are taken by the arduino board and then the board sends the **analog mapped values** to each of the LEDs anodes.<br>
I used the **orange**(for red), **green** and **blue** cables to color code each of the LEDs anodes as well as each of the potentiometers input by their respective color.<br>
The resistances are *100Ω* for the red anode and *220Ω* for the green and blue anodes.
